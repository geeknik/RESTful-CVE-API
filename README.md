This is a Flask application for managing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) data. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on CVE entries using a RESTful API.

## Features

- Importing CVE data from a CSV file into an SQLite database.
- Retrieving CVE details by ID or listing all CVEs.
- Adding new CVE entries.
- Deleting existing CVE entries.
- Updating existing CVE entries.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- SQLite3 (database)
- Postman (for testing API endpoints)

## Imports

- os
- csv

## Usage

1. Retrieving CVE details:

- To retrieve details of a specific CVE by its ID, send a GET request to `/cve/<cve_id>`.
- To list all CVEs, send a GET request to `/cve/all`.

2. Adding new CVE entries:

Send a POST request to `/cve/addCVE` with JSON data containing details of the new CVE entry.

3. Deleting existing CVE entries:

Send a DELETE request to `/cve/<cve_id>` to delete a CVE entry by its ID.

4. Updating existing CVE entries:

Send a PUT request to `/cve/<cve_id>` with JSON data containing updated details of the CVE entry.
